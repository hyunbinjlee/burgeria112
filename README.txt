Project Description:
Burgeria 112 is a game inspired by both Papa's Burgeria and Overcooked. You are in charge of a fast food drive-thru for seven days. 
You must be both speedy and careful as this will impact your score! 
As you progress through the days, you can unlock new toppings like lettuce and tomatoes, but your orders also become more complex.
Make it through all seven days and you win!

How To Play:
Drag and drop items into their proper locations in order to cook them! Remember to create burgers in the sequence given by the order! Also, make sure to place the order in the bag before you serve! Have fun!

To run the game, make sure you have downloaded the folder including all additional images inside. Although you can run the game from any file, be careful of running the game from main.py, as it will first display the previous version of TopLevelApp before displaying the current version so make sure you are on the current version. 

You do not need any additional libraries, and there are no shortcut commands, although you can change app.timer = 300000 (default) in main.py and app.timer = 300000 (default) in timerFired.py to speed up the game, as well as app.levelScores in main.py to change the score needed to advance (each value in the list corresponds to a day).

Disclaimer: It is recommended that you complete each food item one at a time (creating a burger before creating fries or before creating drinks). In addition, when serving the bag to the window, make sure to click on the bag first, then click on the window to be able to move the bag as desired.
